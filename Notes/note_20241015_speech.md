I would like to talk about the return to school holiday, the impact of potential holiday reform in France. 
Over the course of this semester, we have been talking about return to schooling. Yet I would like to deviate from it and talk about return to no-schooling, school holiday. This may be an abuse of the term but let me stick with it for now.

## p2
The idea is motivated by one of the interviews between macron and journalist I listened to on podcast. Last year, EM revived this debate about the length of the school holiday in France. The reasoning behind is exacerbate social inequalities.

This makes sense because who can afford language trips and summer camps are quite obvious. While others are disconnected from school and learning environment, leading to substantial learning loss.

It makes me wonder what would be the right balance the right length of holiday.

why school holiday, the benefits of it is quite obvious, I mean who doesn't like holiday, a period of time where you can travel, relax, explore interests/hobbies other than those included in the school cuuriculum.

yet having a long holiday can have unintended consequences. It may disrupt the learning process, increase inequality, as well as burden the parents who are both working.

So there are two potential reforms around the issue. 
1. The one proposed by EM is to shorten the summer holiday.
2. The other one is to make sure that all have access to holiday activities, whether it is workshops, camps, or something else. This is what the "vacances apprenantes" is aiming at doing.

Let me show you a bit of the background of the two policies.
In terms of the school holiday in Europe. Though almost all neighboring countries are excluded from the table because the variations between states, regions. France is the 7th country with the longest total holiday. When EM mentioned the fact, he is mostly referring to the neighbor, Germany, which does have much less holiday days than in France.

The second reform/program is the learning holiday. The idea is to make sure that all can actually enjoy holiday. The program aims allow kids that do not have the possibility of going on vocation to benefit from a range of activities. It is targeting priority education areas, and more disadvantaged families.

My question is to compare the impact of the two policies. The impact of student performance, but that would have to take into account not only academic achievement (I mean who would want to spend time revising/reviewing stuff during holiday...?) but also physical and mental health etc.

The literature on the topic is mostly from education research. In the US, there are studies on the impact of year round schooling reform and in the UK...

For the first policy, the treatment is the length of holiday. The treatment is compulsory, fixed by the government. Every one complies as well. No self selection issue whatsoever. But there's variation between countries. 

For a change of d-days of holiday. The average treatment effect conditional on social economics status would allow me to see each group of students would benefit/lose from the policy.

## p7

The second policy is the participation in the summer camp. The treatment is not compulsory. There's self-selection issue, likely. Otherwise... The IV (continuous) here is distance to the summer camp/program.
That would allow me to borrow from the MTE framework, use the local IV to estimate the MTE and other treatment effect parameters.

## p8
I would like to conclude with a bit of history of the summer holiday. There's this anecdote that the summer holiday was there for agricultural reasons. That kids would help their parents in the field. But this is rather a misconception because the busy period is in spring and autumn. The long school holiday is more like a result of the urbanisation, there's the need for a break during hot summer months due to a lack of facilities to combat the heat.
Gradually, the tradition has made its way into the culture, and cherished by most as a period of time for leisure, travel and family bonding.

Thank you for your attention!
