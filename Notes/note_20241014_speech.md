Therefore, this little speech/anecdote of the president makes me wonder what would be the right balance.

What is the benefit of having a long holiday? We can relax, explore etc. I mean, who doesn't like holiday.
Second having a holiday that is too long may disrupt the learning process. increase inequality. as well as burden the parents who are both working.

EM proposed that schools ends later and starts earlier
> He said children who were assessed to be behind with school work should
return to classrooms on 20 August for catchup lessons instead of the usual
return at the beginning of September. Secondary schoolchildren, who are
often allowed to finish in June if they do not have exams, should stay at
school for the whole of that month, he said

There are many voices against the idea. Since it primarily concerns teachers and administration. The tourism, transportation industry are also affected. 

Another argument is that instead of not letting students taking holiday, we should make sure that all have access to holiday activities, whether it is workshops, camps, or something else. This is what the "vacances apprenantes" is aiming at doing.

There's no one dominating policy. I would want to know the impact of the two policies.
Haven't decided on the outcome variable yet. as well as when to measure the outcome variable.

For the first policy, the treatment is the length of holiday. I don't think there's any self selection issue in the length of holiday. Every one complies as well. Cross countries comparison controlling for other factors. Conditional on $X$, the average treatment effect. 

For the second policy, the treatment is the attendance of summer school. To be honest I am glad that there's self-selection issue which enables me to use the MTE framework and the local IV to estimate the treatment effect.
The IV is the distance to the summer camp.
